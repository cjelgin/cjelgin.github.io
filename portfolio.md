### Image Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow
#### [Image Recognition - Classifying Bird Species from Image](https://github.com/cjelgin/bird_classifier)

This project involved using transfer learning to train a CNN for the purpose of classifying images of birds into respective species. The images came from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle, and were used to train a CNN build on the popular Xception model using the TensorFlow framework for Python. The model is capable of classyfing birds into 175 different species with 98% accuracy. The source code and testing code are available in the GitHub repo, and a TensorFlow Serving Docker image pre-loaded with the model is available on DockerHub. With the Docker image, the model can be deoployed most anywhere, can be queried through a REST API, and supports versioning.

### Masters Thesis - KU Leuven June 2019
#### Reliability Analysis of Mechanical Equipment in a Cement Production Plant

In June 2019, I completed work on my Master's thesis as the culmination of my two-year program at KU Leuven. As indicated by the sheer length of my document, the nature of my project enabled me to approach a solution from an enormity of angles. I was fortunate enough to be tasked with a concrete(pun absolutely intended) problem with a trove of historical data at my disposal. Using knowledge from my previous Generalized Linear Models, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Survival Analysis courses, I implemented a widely applicable methodology that I'm proud of.

### Statistical Analysis
#### [The Effect of Beetroot Juice on Cycling Performance, a Meta-Analysis](/documents/Carl-Elgin-meta-analysis.pdf)

In May 2018 as part of the statistics curriculum I carried out considerable research and performed an independent meta analysis on a topic of my chosing. Being an endurance athlete, I had always wondered about the science and facts behind alleged recovery-aids. This project seemed the perfect opportunity to finally separate fact from fiction.

### Privacy and Big Data
#### [Strava Privacy Impact Assessment](documents/Elgin_Privacy_Impact_Assessment.pdf)

The culmination of the _Privacy and Big Data_ course at KU Leuven involved taking what we had learned and performing a __Privacy Impact Assessment__ of our own. I chose to examine _Strava_, a hybrid platform at the intersection of exercise/training log and social network. Despite being a long time user(made easy by cross-platform activity syncing) I learned a great deal about the amount of value generated from aggregated activity data. Regardless of what I discovered, I still continue to use the platform in the same semi-passive manner.
