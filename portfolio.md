### Masters Thesis - KU Leuven June 2019

In June 2019, I completed work on my Master's thesis as the culmination of my two-year program at KU Leuven. As indicated by the sheer length of my document, the nature of my project enabled me to approach a solution from an enormity of angles. I was fortunate enough to be tasked with a concrete(pun absolutely intended) problem with a trove of historical data at my disposal. Using knowledge from my previous Generalized Linear Models, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Survival Analysis courses, I implemented a widely applicable methodology that I'm proud of.
